pak installs R packages from CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, and local files
and directories. It is an alternative to `install.packages()` and
`devtools::install_github()`. pak is fast, safe and convenient.

## Installation

Install the released version of the package from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("pak")
```

(After installation, you might also want to run `pak::pak_setup()`; it'll
be run automatically when needed but you might want to do it now to save
some time later.)

Install the development version from our repository on GitHub:

```r
install.packages("pak", repos = "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/dev/")
```

This is currently supported for

* macOS and R 3.3.x or later, including R-devel
* Windows and R 3.3.x, or later, including R-devel
* Linux (any 64-bit distribution) and R 3.3.x or later, including R-devel

## Usage

Call `pkg_install()` to install CRAN or Bioconductor packages:

```r
pak::pkg_install("usethis")
```

To install GitHub packages, use the `user/repo` syntax:

```r
pak::pkg_install("r-lib/usethis")
```

All dependencies will be installed as well, to the same library.

### On GitHub Actions

The [`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) repository has an
`R CMD check` GitHub Action that uses pak to install packages:
https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/check-pak.yaml
To set up this action for your own repository, run
```r
usethis::use_github_action("check-pak")
```
from R.

## Why pak?

### Fast

* Fast downloads and HTTP queries. pak performs all HTTP requests
  concurrently.

* Fast installs. pak builds and installs packages concurrently.

* Metadata and package cache. pak caches package metadata and all downloaded
  packages locally. It does not download the same package files over and
  over again.

* Lazy installation. pak only installs the packages that are really
  necessary for the installation. If the requested package and its
  dependencies are already installed, pak does nothing.

### Safe

* Private library (pak's own package dependencies do not affect your
  regular package libraries and vice versa).

* Every pak operation runs in a sub-process, and the packages are loaded
  from the private library. pak avoids loading packages from your regular
  package libraries. 
  (These package files would be locked on some systems, and locked packages
  cannot be updated. pak does not load any package in the main process,
  except for pak itself).

* To avoid updating locked packages, pak warns and requests confirmation
  for loaded packages.

* Dependency solver. pak makes sure that you end up in a consistent, working
  state of dependencies. It finds conflicts up front, before attempting
  installation.

### Convenient

* BioC packages. pak supports Bioconductor packages out of the box. It
  uses the Bioconductor version that is appropriate for your R version.

* GitHub packages. pak supports GitHub packages out of the box. It also
  supports the `Remotes` entry in `DESCRIPTION` files,
  so that GitHub dependencies of GitHub packages will also get installed.
  See e.g.
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes/vignettes/dependencies.html>

* Package sizes. For CRAN packages pak shows the total sizes of packages
  it needs to download.

## Caching package compilation

Some packages require compilation of source files to work. This
compilation process is relatively time consuming and will be repeated
every time package is re-installed or upgraded. Linux and Mac users
can use the tool ccache to cache the results of the initial
compilation and skip most of the compilation time the next time a
package is installed through pak (or other means).


### Setting up ccache

The first step is to install ccache through your package manager or
[manually](https://ccache.dev/documentation.html). Successful
installation can be verified by running the command

```
ccache -V
```

from the command line. This will show the version of ccache installed
on your system.

R can be instructed which files to use for compilation of packages
through the Makevars file in `~/.R/Makevars`. This can be done as follows:

```
CCACHE=ccache
CC=$(CCACHE) gcc$(VER)
CXX=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
CXX11=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
CXX14=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
FC=$(CCACHE) gfortran$(VER)
F77=$(CCACHE) gfortran$(VER)
```

and by adding the following to your ccache configuration in
`~/.ccache/ccache.conf`:

```
max_size = 1.0G
# Important for R CMD INSTALL *.tar.gz as tarballs are expanded again and again
# and therefore appear new to ccache.
sloppiness = include_file_ctime
# The packages will be unpacked into temporary directories with random file
# names. Therefore it is important to ignore the file path of the file that is
# being compiled.
hash_dir = false
```

ccache will now start building a cache of compiled source files and
then speed up package installation.

## Roadmap

* Support GitLab repositories
* Support Bitbucket repositories
* Support package URLs
* Support system requirements
* Support older CRAN package versions
* Support older BioConductor package versions
* Support GitHub pull requests
* Support local CRAN mirrors
* Support the `Additional_repositories` `DESCRIPTION` field
* Support SVN repos
